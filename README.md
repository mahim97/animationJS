Animation is used to simulate the behaviour of variety of materials based on their transparency. A light source(candle) is used as the fixed object that can be seen through the transparent and translucent objects. Many types of objects were rendered like glass, paper, rubber ball etc. Rubber ball acting as a Opaque object, paper as translucent object, glass and plastic bottle as transparent object. It also has a set of questions.
